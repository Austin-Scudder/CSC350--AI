This sample code shows how one can read in our JSON image files in Python3.  It reads in the file and then outputs the two-dimensional array.
It applies a simple threshold test - if value is > threshold then it outputs a '.' otherwise it outputs an 'X'.  More refinement is probably better.
But this is for displaying images not processing or recognizing images."""
